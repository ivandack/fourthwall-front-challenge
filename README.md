This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## My Fourthwall Frontend Engineer Coding Challenge

This is the code for the [Fourthwall Frontend Engineer Coding Challenge](https://gist.github.com/wpasinski/965c7c2d949610a651c995b56875a522)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn storybook`

Runs the [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) server to show the implementation of some of the components: I didn't use this for documentation.


### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
